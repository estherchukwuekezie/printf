# _printf

A formatted output conversion C project completed as part of the low-level
programming and algorithm track at ALX. The program is a pseudo-
recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

## Dependencies

The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 11.2.0.

## Usage

To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed, compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `main.h` with any main function.

## Description

The function `_printf` writes output to standard output. The function writes
under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments
(accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of `stdarg`) are
converted for output.
